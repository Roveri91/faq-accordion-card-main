## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS variable
- JavaScript


### What I learned

The HTML code was pretty basic with a main container divided in two section;
  1) the img section:

  ```html
  <section class="images-container">
      <div class="main-image-container">
        /*main img*/
        /*shadow img*/
      </div>
      
      <img class="block-image" src="images/illustration-box-desktop.svg" alt="a square box with the @ mark">
    
  </section>
  ```
  2) The Text section:
  ```html
  <section class="text-container">
      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Question and answer.
      </ul>
  </section>
  ```


I decide to add the arrow icon at the end of the question using the ::after attribute and animate it with the transform property:

```css
  h3::after {
    content: url(images/icon-arrow-down.svg);
    float: right;
    transition: transform 1.5s;
}

  .show h3::after {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
    transition: transform 1.5s;
}
```

Place the img in the right place taking care of the overflow was pretty challenging but i managed it using some basic CSS rules.

```css
.main-illustration {
        position: relative;
        display: grid;
        top: -6rem;
    }
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

The Javascript part was pretty basic and use few Selector and a click event.
I then make sure that no other li element has the show class before toggle on the clicked element. 

```js
  questions.forEach(question => { 
    question.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        const clicked = e.target.closest('li');
        questions.forEach(element => {
            if(element.classList.contains("show") && element != clicked)
            {
                element.classList.remove("show");
            }
        })
        clicked.classList.toggle("show");

    })   
});
```

### Continued development


Place the picture in the right place was pretty challenging especialy for the Desktop design.
In the future i would like to focusing more on the element positioning.
